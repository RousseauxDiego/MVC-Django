# MVC-Django

## Description  
In this project, I followed a demo to explore the use of Django within an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Django helps implement the MVC pattern by structuring the application into three primary components: the model, view, and controller.

## Key Concepts  
1. **Model**  
   - Defines the structure of the data and interacts with the database.
2. **View**  
   - Responsible for presenting the data to the user, usually in the form of templates.
3. **Controller**  
   - Manages the request flow and business logic, directing the data to the appropriate views.

## Framework  
- **Django** is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

## Features  
- Follows the MVC pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
- Provides a clean interface for defining models, handling requests, and rendering views.
